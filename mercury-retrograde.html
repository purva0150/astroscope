          <div class="desc">
            Mercury retrograde is an optical illusion that occurs when the planet Mercury appears to move backward in its orbit from our perspective on Earth. This happens three to four times a year, and each retrograde period lasts about three weeks.
          </div>
          <div class="desc">
            In astrology, Mercury rules communication, technology, travel, and commerce. When Mercury is retrograde, these areas of life often experience disruptions, delays, and miscommunications.

          <div class="desc">
            During Mercury retrograde periods, you might experience communication breakdowns, travel delays, technology issues, and unexpected changes in plans. It's a time when misunderstandings are more likely to occur.

            However, Mercury retrograde can also be a time for reflection, revisiting past projects, and tying up loose ends. It's an excellent period for reviewing and revising rather than starting new ventures.

          <div class="desc">
            To navigate Mercury retrograde successfully, it's important to be extra careful with communications, double-check important documents, and be patient with delays. Avoid making major decisions or starting new projects during this time.
          </div>
          <div class="desc">
            Use this period to review, reflect, and reconnect with old friends or projects. It's a perfect time for introspection and completing unfinished business rather than beginning new endeavors.
