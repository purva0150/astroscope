            Your sun sign represents your core personality, ego, and the essence of who you are. It's determined by the position of the Sun at the time of your birth and is the most commonly known aspect of your astrological profile.

          <div class="desc">
            The sun sign influences your basic character traits, your approach to life, and how you express yourself. It's like your astrological fingerprint, shaping your fundamental nature and how you interact with the world around you.

            To determine your sun sign, you need to know your birth date. The sun moves through each zodiac sign approximately every 30 days, creating the twelve zodiac periods we know today.

            For example, if you were born between March 21 and April 19, your sun sign is Aries. Each sign has its own unique characteristics, strengths, and challenges that influence your personality and life path.
